  <h2>My Experience with Swisschems Raloxifene 20 mg Capsules</h2>
  <p>I’ve tried a lot of post‑cycle therapy (PCT) products over the years. When I saw Swisschems’ <strong>Raloxifene 20 mg</strong> capsules, I was curious. I ordered a bottle and ran a full 4‑week PCT. Here’s what I learned.</p>

  <h2>What Is Raloxifene?</h2>
  <p>Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). It helps block excess estrogen after an anabolic cycle. That keeps gains strong and side effects low. It’s also used in medical hormone therapy to support bone health.</p>

  <h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
  <p>I ran a 12‑week bulking cycle of testosterone enanthate. Two weeks after my last injection, I started Raloxifene at 20 mg daily. I logged my weight, strength, mood, and any aches each week. I also compared it to my last PCT with tamoxifen. I rated it on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Estrogen control</strong> – how well it managed water retention and mood swings</li>
    <li><strong>Strength retention</strong> – maintaining bench press and squat numbers</li>
    <li><strong>Side‑effect profile</strong> – any joint pain, hot flashes, or fatigue</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use</strong> – capsule size, dosage simplicity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Results and Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stable mood:</strong> I felt calm and focused, with no sudden mood swings.</li>
    <li><strong>Water retention:</strong> Minimal bloating compared to my tamoxifen run.</li>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> I kept 90 % of my bench and squat numbers over PCT.</li>
    <li><strong>Bone support:</strong> No aches in joints or bones even with higher lifts.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple dosing:</strong> One 20 mg capsule each morning with food.</li>
  </ul>
